This notebook contains some basic EDA for the big five dataset. In the course of the analysis, we notice some trends and perform statistical tests to formalize our hypothesis. This is still a work-in-progress, and a lot more can be added. I am making this public as there are many open questions and subject-matter based assumptions, and it would be great to get suggestions/insights from you on the work so far and what else can be done.
